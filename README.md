## Mobile & Full-Stack Developer | Flutter & AI Engineer
**Shipped 2 Apps (5K+ Downloads) | 1K+ Subs @ KTM Academy | Data-Informed Product Builder**

## About Me
I build mobile-first products that ship under real constraints—low-end devices, limited connectivity, and non-technical users. Most of my work sits at the intersection of Flutter-based mobile apps, lightweight backends, and applied AI, with a focus on education, public-sector tools, and early-stage products where speed and maintainability matter more than theoretical perfection.

## How I Build
I start by writing the problem down to remove ambiguity, research existing approaches and tradeoffs, and then design the smallest version that can work in production. I prefer shipping early, observing real usage, and iterating, rather than over-designing systems upfront. Tool choices are driven by operational simplicity, not trend-following.
